# Contribution Policies
## Filing Issues
Feel free to file issues about the framework here or contact me through the Discord. I am open to all suggestions on how to improve the framework.

## Pull Requests
There are automated tests that run when a PR is created to the develop or master branches. These tests must pass before a PR can be merged. All PRs must merge into the develop branch.

## Branching
All features must be branched off the develop branch.
